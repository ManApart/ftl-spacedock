FTL_Spacedock
=============
This program has been absorbed into my new program, FTL Homeworld. Check it out here:
https://github.com/iceburg333/FTL-Homeworld

My first Java program, FTL Spacedock will allow players to manage multiple ships, so that they can play different ships at the same time. Dock a ship to store it and then start a new game or board another ship. Then use boarding/docking to switch between ships at any time.

I'm still learning the ropes of eclipse, java, and github, but felt that I had enough done to warrent an upload to github. I will be working on improving the gui of the program, and then release it as a compiled jar to the FTL forum, (and will update the readme with a link).

//I've modeled this class after SavedGameState (from FTL Editor), as well as copied and then modified chunks of its code.
//Anything that reads or writes savegame data was either inspired by, copied from, or depends on FTL Editor
//I'm especially indebted to Vhati who gave me permission to use the code as well as answered my questions as I worked through my first java program.
